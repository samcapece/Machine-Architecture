# Machine Architecture and Organization Course Projects

## Course Overview

This repository contains the projects for the Machine Architecture and Organization course (CSCI 2021) at the University of Minnesota. The course covers fundamental concepts in machine architecture including assembly language, processor design, memory hierarchies, and optimization techniques. Projects in this course are designed to provide hands-on experience with low-level programming, performance optimization, and system-level analysis.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Assembly Programming Basics
- **Objective**: Introduced assembly programming. Tasks included writing simple assembly routines to perform arithmetic operations and control flow.
- **Key Concepts**: Basic syntax and operations in x86 assembly, stack management, and subroutine calls.

### Project 2: Debugging and Reverse Engineering
- **Objective**: Focused on using debugging tools to reverse engineer given binary files.
- **Key Concepts**: Use of GNU Debugger (gdb) to dissect and understand assembly code, enhancing skills in identifying the functionality of unknown binaries.

### Project 3: Advanced Assembly and Optimization
- **Objective**: Extended assembly programming to include optimization techniques for improving the performance of provided code snippets.
- **Key Concepts**: Instruction-level optimization, branch prediction, and effective cache utilization.

### Project 4: Data Analysis and Computational Efficiency
- **Objective**: Involved writing and optimizing algorithms for high-efficiency data processing, particularly focusing on matrix operations and data structure manipulation.
- **Key Concepts**: Advanced optimization, performance analysis (wall time vs. CPU time), and algorithmic efficiency in a high-level programming environment.

## Repository Structure

Each project folder contains:
- Source files: Implementation of project requirements.
- Documentation: Specific instructions and objectives for each project.
- Makefiles: Scripts for compiling the projects and running tests.
