# Machine Architecture and Organization Course Projects

## Course Overview

This repository contains all the projects from the Machine Architecture and Organization course. The course offers a deep dive into computer architecture, focusing on assembly language, system-level programming, debugging, and optimization techniques. Each project within this repository is aimed at enhancing practical skills in handling complex machine-level programming challenges.

## Project Summaries

### Project 1: Gradebook Program

**Objective**: Implement a gradebook application in C using a hash table to manage student grades.

### Project 2: Bitwise Operations and Debugging Puzzles

**Objective**: Solve programming puzzles using bitwise operations and debug a complex software using GNU Debugger.

### Project 3: Assembly Programming and Debugging

**Objective**: Develop and debug assembly language programs, transitioning from high-level C programming.

### Project 4: Advanced Data Analysis and Optimization

**Objective**: Optimize data processing algorithms for better computational efficiency.

## Repository Structure

Each project folder contains source files, a Makefile for building the projects, and a specific README detailing the project objectives, setup instructions, and usage guide.
